# Badger DB

BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent, and fast key-value (KV) database written in pure Go. It is the underlying database for Dgraph, a fast, distributed graph database. It's meant to be a performant alternative to non-Go-based key-value stores like RocksDB[doc](https://dgraph.io/docs/badger/).
